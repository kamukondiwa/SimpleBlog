Simple blog.

A very simple blogging engine that I built in ASP.Net MVC.

Developed using TDD with MSpec and RhinoMocks. I make use of some cool technologies including MEF, Spark view engine and xVal. I aimed to create a SOLIDly built and re-usable application. UI sucks though and could do with another refresh.
